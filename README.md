# dnsIntel
**dnsIntel** is a tool for creating custom modules that downloads domains classified as malware or advertising from popular threat intelligence sources, and building a blocklist which can be used by DNS servers such as DNSMASQ or BIND.

## Motivation
The motivation behind dnsIntel was to protect my own network from malvertising and new threats by blocking on the DNS level. I run DNSMASQ in my homelab and needed a way to automatically block new threats, and so dnsIntel was born.

## How does it work?
dnsIntel tries to be framework which gives you all the necessary tools in order to write a small script that downloads new domains from any source, and updates your DNS server with new domains to block. The `config.json` contains all configuration and sources from which to download from. Everything is stored in a local sqlite database file. dnsIntel will build a blacklist file containing your blocked doamins according to DNSMASQ format.

Scripts/modules can be found in the module folder.

### Example output

Here are some examples of using dnsIntel.
#### Usage example:
```
Usage: dnsintel.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  dnsIntel downloads and parses a list of domains from popular threat intel
  sources, then transforms the list into a blacklist which can be used by
  Dnsmasq and BIND.
